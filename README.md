## TextForm Component Documentation

### Overview

The `TextForm` component is a simple React component designed for text manipulation. It provides a user interface for entering text and converting it to uppercase. This documentation provides a brief overview of its functionality.

### Usage

To use the `TextForm` component, follow these steps:

1. Import the component:

   ```javascript
   import TextForm from "./TextForm"; // Update the path as needed
   ```

2. Include the component in your JSX, specifying the `heading` prop:

   ```javascript
   <TextForm heading="Text Manipulation Tool" />
   ```

### Props

- `heading` (string): This prop sets the heading/title for the component, displayed at the top.

### Functionality

The `TextForm` component offers the following functionality:

- **Textarea Input**: Users can input text in a textarea. The text is controlled by the component's state.

- **Convert to Uppercase Button**: Clicking the "Convert to Upper Case" button converts the text in the textarea to uppercase and updates the displayed text.

### State Management

The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage the `text` state. The initial value is "Enter the text," and it updates as users type or click the conversion button.

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the `TextForm` component:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import TextForm from "./TextForm";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <TextForm heading="Text Manipulation Tool" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Styling

Ensure that you include the "TextForm.css" file in your project for proper styling. Customize the CSS as needed to match your application's design.

That's a brief overview of the `TextForm` component's usage and functionality.
